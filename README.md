Implementation
===============

1.  Obtain and organise static assets (high res images, fonts, colour theme
    etc.)

2.  Initial responsive page structure with flexbox.

    1.  Define content divisions, image placement and navigation.

3.  Implement static shell

4.  Initial style pass

    1.  Colour themes suited to each team

    2.  Minimalist design using responsive material design practices

    3.  Specify and organise reusable code (e.g. SASS mixins)

    4.  Parallax scrolling

5.  Draw charts and graphs on front-end (Static data)

    1.  Define JS functions to retrieve, process and display

    2.  Specify reusable components

        1.  Encapsulate each component allowing changes to be made from the UI

        2.  Follow Model-View-Controller

            1.  Model is the raw data

            2.  View is the web UI components

            3.  Controller interfaces with the view/model to get and update
                values, without the view and model interacting directly â€“ i.e.
                controller is the coordinating object

    3.  Implement Chart.js to visualise data in responsive components

6.  Animate content

7.  Admin interface to edit data

    1.  Web UI with forms to update charts manually

    2.  Implement some form of CMS to handle changes with secure credentials

    3.  Send changes to required component

8.  Handle dynamic data and back-end (Node.js or Python)

    1.  Create database

    2.  Store and retrieve data, fetch from API sources and send updates to
        front-end

    3.  Automate retrieval and processing
